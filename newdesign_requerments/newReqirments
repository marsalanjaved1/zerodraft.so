Below is a **single, BIG, copy-paste-ready prompt** you can drop straight into **Antigravity**.

It assumes:

* You already uploaded **existing mockups**
* Product name: **zerodraft.so**
* Goal: **redesign into a true agentic AI co-writer**
* Platform: **white-theme web app**
* Audience: serious writers, researchers, PMs, engineers

No commentary. Just the prompt.

```
You are Antigravity, acting as a principal product designer + AI systems designer.

You are redesigning an existing white-theme web app called zerodraft.so into a
production-grade **agentic AI co-writer**, not a chatbot and not a text generator.

I have already uploaded the current UI mockups.
Use them as a baseline, not a constraint.

Your task is to redesign zerodraft.so so the AI behaves like a **writing agent**
that collaborates, plans, critiques, and iterates — while the human remains in control.

================================================================
CORE PRODUCT DEFINITION
================================================================

zerodraft.so helps users go from:
• zero → outline → draft → refined writing
with explicit, reversible AI assistance.

AI never overwrites content silently.
AI proposes, explains, and waits for approval.

================================================================
AGENTIC AI CONCEPT
================================================================

The AI is not a single chatbot.
It is a **multi-capability writing agent** with clear roles:

• Planner — structures outlines and writing plans
• Drafter — writes section-by-section, never whole documents by default
• Editor — improves clarity, tone, flow, and coherence
• Critic — points out gaps, weak arguments, or logical issues
• Research helper — manages citations and sources
• Memory keeper — tracks user intent, tone, and document goals

These roles are visible to the user as modes, not hidden abstractions.

================================================================
PRIMARY UI LAYOUT
================================================================

Maintain a desktop-first 3-pane layout:

LEFT PANE — Workspace
• Projects, documents, research notes
• Writing goals and document intent
• Agent task history (what the AI has done so far)

CENTER PANE — Editor
• The primary writing surface
• Rich text + markdown hybrid
• Inline AI suggestions, never modal-only
• Tracked changes, ghost text, inline diffs
• Outline-first drafting workflow
• Section-level drafting controls

RIGHT PANE — AI Agent Panel
• Not a chat log
• A task-oriented agent console
• Shows:
  – Current agent role
  – Active task
  – Proposed actions
  – Reasoning summary (short, optional)
• Buttons to approve, reject, refine, or redirect

================================================================
AGENT TASK MODEL
================================================================

The AI operates through explicit tasks.

Examples:
• “Create an outline for this document”
• “Draft section 2 using this outline”
• “Critique the argument in this section”
• “Improve clarity without changing meaning”
• “Add citations for these claims”

Each task:
• Has a clear goal
• Shows scope (selection / section / document)
• Produces previewable output
• Requires user approval to apply

No background autonomous changes.

================================================================
EDITOR BEHAVIOR
================================================================

Design the editor so AI assistance feels native.

Key behaviors:
• Selection-aware actions (rewrite, expand, critique)
• Ghost text suggestions (Tab to accept, Esc to reject)
• Tracked AI edits with Accept / Reject
• Section-level “Ask agent” actions
• Inline comments from the Critic agent
• Outline nodes that can be expanded into prose

AI never hijacks cursor or scroll position.

================================================================
AGENT MEMORY & INTENT
================================================================

The AI maintains explicit, user-visible memory:

• Document goal (e.g. blog post, paper, PRD)
• Target audience
• Desired tone
• Constraints (length, formality, stance)

Memory is editable by the user at any time.
Memory is shown as editable chips or panels.

================================================================
RESEARCH & CITATIONS
================================================================

Citations are first-class.

• Inline numbered markers
• Sources panel with accept/remove controls
• Clear labeling of placeholders vs verified sources
• Ability to ask the agent:
  – “Add citations to this paragraph”
  – “Check factual accuracy”

No fabricated sources.

================================================================
AGENT EXPLANATION LEVEL
================================================================

The agent explains its actions only when useful.

• Short reasoning summaries
• Optional “Why this suggestion?” toggles
• No long chain-of-thought dumps

Design UI for trust, not verbosity.

================================================================
KEYBOARD & POWER USER UX
================================================================

Design for keyboard-first workflows:

• ⌘K — command palette
• / — slash commands
• Tab — accept suggestion
• Esc — reject suggestion
• ⌘Z — undo agent actions

Fast, predictable, no animations.

================================================================
FOCUS & CONTROL
================================================================

Include a focus mode:
• Collapses sidebars
• Centers editor
• Keeps agent available but quiet

User always feels in control.

================================================================
WHAT TO AVOID
================================================================

Do NOT design:
• Auto-writing entire documents
• Hidden autonomous behavior
• Chat-only UX
• Decorative UI elements
• Dark patterns or lock-in visuals

================================================================
DELIVERABLES
================================================================

Produce:
• Updated high-fidelity UI mockups
• Clear agent-first interaction patterns
• Explicit task-based AI flows
• Empty, loading, and error states
• A cohesive redesign that makes zerodraft.so feel
  like a serious, trustworthy, agentic co-writer

Design with restraint, clarity, and professional rigor.
